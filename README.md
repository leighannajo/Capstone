**Data Description:** <br>
Due to healthcare PHI regulations (HIPAA, HITECH), there are limited number of publicly available datasets and some datasets require training and approval. So, for this project I am using a dataset from UC Irvine(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008).

## Motivation / Objective

**Objective:** <br>
This project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level, with appropriate filtering and preprocessing/feature engineering of key medical code sets. This project will also analyze and interpret a model for biases across key demographic groups.

**Context:** <br>
EHR data is becoming a key source of real-world evidence (RWE) for the pharmaceutical industry and regulators to make decisions on clinical trials.
